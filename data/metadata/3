    "name": "M90 shotgun",
    "description": "The M90 is a pump-action shotgun, chambered in the extremely powerful 8-gauge magnum shell, and feeding from a 12-round, dual-tubular, non-detachable magazine. It is generally utilized alongside MAG 15P-00B rounds, and is designed as a more practical and cost-effective recreation of Misriah Armoryâ€™s M45E Tactical Shotgun, though in UNSC service it is considered to be functionally identical.",
