    "description": "The gravity hammers evolved from traditional war hammers wielded by Jiralhanae war chieftains, which were a major focus of the Jiralhanae's barbaric culture, as it serves as the ultimate symbol of clan leadership in addition to being a powerful weapon. The ceremonial hammer of a pack or a clan is only passed to another Jiralhanae if he can best his chieftain in ceremonial combat; the mantle of leadership passes along with the weapon. The wielder of the weapon was expected to treat their gravity hammer with great care.",
