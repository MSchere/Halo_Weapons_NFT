    "name": "Type-50 SRS SRS Beam Rifle",
    "description": "The Type-50 SRS is a battery-powered directed energy weapon that fires ionized particle beams. The battery for the weapon has enough charge to fire ten shots. The muzzle velocity of the weapon is 3657 m/s (12,000 f/s), with a maximum effective range of roughly 1,500 m (4900 ft) When firing, the weapon has a near-silent and negligible muzzle signature, and inflicts wounds comparable to the 14.5Ã—114mm round fired by the UNSC's SRS99 series of sniper rifles, capable of instantly killing a target. The beam rifle has a barrel length of 82.55 cm (32.5 in.) and an overall length of 160.4 cm (63.2 in.), weighing in at 18 kg (39.6 lbs).",
