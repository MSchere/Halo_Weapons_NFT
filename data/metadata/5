    "name": "H-165 Target Locator",
    "description": "The H-165 FOM is a compact, handheld laser device designed for acquiring and designating targets for small-scale orbital bombardment from an orbiting UNSC starshipand nearby aircraft, and is typically used by Joint Fires Observer personnel. The H-165 Target Locator was preceded by the H-120 and the H-155 FOM models and was superseded in the post-war era by the H-295 FOM. While similar in function to the laser designator, the Target Locator is much smaller and can be held with one hand. The Target Locator also features a scope for target acquisition accuracy at greater range and an intercom for user communication.",
